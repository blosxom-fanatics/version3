EntryType: bookmark to x180
meta-entrytype: bookmark
meta-url: http://www.x180.net/
This entry is also different.  The presence of a meta-entrytype tag triggers the EntryType plugin. The entry
is marked as being of type "bookmark", which causes the entry to be rendered using the entry.bookmark template
component.
